This code is taken from an e-commerce application I developed to showcase my expertise in backend technologies.
The backend is built using Laravel, with custom REST APIs implemented in compliance with SOLID principles and PSR standards.
The code includes comprehensive annotations, type casting, and integration with third-party services.


The application follows the Laravel Layered Architecture, where each layer serves a specific purpose:


- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Services: Contain business logic.
- Subscribers: Manage event handling.
- Requests: Handle input validation.
- Resources: Format and structure API output.
- Jobs: Execute asynchronous tasks in the background.


Laravel's inbuilt ORM, Eloquent, is utilized for defining model relationships, managing fillable attributes, constants, and data casting, etc.
